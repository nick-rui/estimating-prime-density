# Probabilistic Methods to Estimate Prime Number Density

We introduce two probabilistic applications that relate to prime numbers. 
* A Bayesian Primality test that can rapidly distinguish if a number is 'probably prime' or 'definitely composite'
* A Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to estimate the proportion of primes from [1, n] (i.e., verifying the Prime Number Theorem)
